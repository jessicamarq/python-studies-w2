# Python Course - World 2 (Control Structures)

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from **World 2** of the Python course provided by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemVídeo), taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara.

# About the Module
**World 2** dives deeper into programming logic. The main goal is to master control flow, allowing the code to make complex decisions and repeat tasks automatically.

# Topics Covered:
- **Nested Conditions:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to create multiple decision paths.
- **"For" Loops:** Structures for iterating over fixed ranges or sequences.
- **"While" Loops:** Structures for repeating tasks based on logical conditions.
- **Loop Interruption:** Using `break` to stop loops and infinite loops management.
- **Logic Games:** Building more complex interactions like *Jokenpô* (Rock-Paper-Scissors) and *Guessing Game v2.0*.
